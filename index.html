	 Responsive Portfolio Website</a></h2>
	</header>
	<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/KKmKWZg" class="image fit"><img src="pers-web1.png" alt="" /></a>
	 <p>Interactive and user-friendly personal portfolio website with clickable call-to-action buttons with added animation. Profile picture created with 'blob' in Figma. This portfolio website was built with the programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript with added stylizing to bring buttons and icons to life when interacted with. The website features a ‘dark mode’ button which, when prompted by the user, will change the colour scheme of the website between ‘light’ and ‘dark’. This website has been built to adapt to the sizes of various handheld devices such as mobile phone, iPad, tablet and laptop.</p>

	<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/VwWNKYO" class="image fit"><img src="pixelrain.png" alt="" /></a>
	 <p>I have created an animated pixel effect to mimic the down pour of rain in various speeds and pixel size to recreate the image I have uploaded. This was created with 'for loops' and the function 'Math.random()' to randomly manipulate the 5000 pixels' movement in their speed and velocity as well as the pixel size which creates the 'raining' effect. This project was created with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.</p>

										Responsive Bar Chart</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/poPMgKm" class="image fit"><img src="vis data.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>Responsive bar chart that showcases my ability to use JavaScript and an svg-based visualization library - D3 - to show data to users. The bar chart becomes active by the use of the 'tooltip' funtction in JavaScript which highlights and produces the correct information when hovering over a particular year. This project also showacses my ability to successfully use elements to create a X and Y Axis with correct 'tick labels' to allow me to display the bar charts that I then created with JavaScript to display all of the data required in a user-friendly manner. This project was built using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and D3 as part of the final five projects for the Data Visualization Certification with FreeCodeCamp for completing 300 hours of coursework.</p>

										Technical Documentation Page</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/bGWeXmr" class="image fit"><img src="technicaldoc.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>One-page website of displaying technical documentation on information regarding JavaScript, showing the use of ‘code’, 'a' and 'ul'/'li' tags. As part of the challenge, I have successfully used 'id' tags which correspond to the 'a'/‘anchor’ in the navbar within the HTML code which allows the user to be taken to a specific section of the website. As the navigation menu has a "fixed" position, this makes it easier for the user to then select a new area without the need to continuously scroll. This tribute page was built with the programming languages HTML 5 and CSS as part of the final five projects for the Responsive Web Design Certification with FreeCodeCamp for completing 300 hours of coursework.</p>

									<p>Static one-page website of an individual of choice, showing the use of ‘div’, ‘id’ and ‘img’ tags. As part of the challenge, I have embedded a link using ‘anchor’ tags into an image within the HTML code which allows the user to be taken to a separate window to the individuals YouTube page once the image has been selected.
