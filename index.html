	 Responsive Portfolio Website</a></h2>
	</header>
	<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/KKmKWZg" class="image fit"><img src="pers-web1.png" alt="" /></a>
	 <p>
		 Designed and developed a responsive personal portfolio website to showcase projects and technical skills through an interactive, user-focused interface. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with animated call-to-action components and hover-based micro-interactions to enhance usability and engagement. Implemented a dark mode toggle feature that dynamically switches between light and dark themes, improving accessibility and user preference support. The site was developed with a mobile-first, responsive layout, ensuring consistent performance and visual presentation across a wide range of devices including smartphones, tablets, and desktop screens. Custom UI elements, including the profile graphic, were created in Figma using blob-style design techniques to establish a modern and cohesive personal brand.

	 JavaScript Pixelated Image Animation</a></h2>
	</header>
	<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/VwWNKYO" class="image fit"><img src="pixelrain.png" alt="" /></a>
	 <p>
		 Developed an interactive pixel-based animation in JavaScript to simulate a rainfall-like visual effect over an uploaded image. The project dynamically generates and manipulates approximately 5,000 individual pixel elements, creating the illusion of motion through randomized velocity, size variation, and speed adjustments. The animation logic was implemented using nested for-loops and JavaScript’s Math.random() function to introduce natural, non-uniform movement patterns and enhance realism. This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as iteration, randomness, and real-time DOM-based animation. Built using HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript, with a focus on creative visual effects and algorithmic control of graphical elements.

			</header>
				<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/LYjZypK" class="image fit"><img src="ProductLandingPage.png" alt="" /></a>
				<p>
					Designed and built a responsive product landing page featuring interactive UI elements and smooth user navigation. Developed using HTML5 and CSS, with animated call-to-action buttons and a streamlined scrolling experience enhanced by a fixed background image reveal effect for added visual depth. Integrated embedded multimedia content through a playable YouTube video, and implemented a user contact form allowing visitors to submit messages and email details, supporting basic user interaction and engagement. This project was completed as part of FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certification, representing over 300 hours of structured coursework and serving as one of the final capstone-style builds in the program.

			<h2><a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/poPMgKm">Project 4<br />
			Responsive Bar Chart</a></h2>
		</header>
		<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/poPMgKm" class="image fit"><img src="vis data.png" alt="" /></a>
		<p>
			Developed a fully responsive SVG-based bar chart visualization using JavaScript and the D3.js library to present time-series data in a clear, user-friendly format. The chart includes dynamically generated bars, along with accurately scaled X and Y axes, complete with tick marks and labels to support readable interpretation of the dataset. Implemented interactive functionality through a tooltip system, enabling users to hover over individual bars to reveal contextual data values for specific years. This demonstrates proficiency in DOM manipulation, event handling, and building engaging data-driven UI components. The project was built with HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, and D3.js, and completed as part of FreeCodeCamp’s Data Visualization Certification, representing over 300 hours of applied coursework and serving as one of the program’s final capstone projects.

			Responsive Scatter Plot Graph</a></h2>
		</header>
		<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/VwboEwr" class="image fit"><img src="scattergraph.png" alt="" /></a>
		<p>Built an interactive, responsive scatter plot visualization using JavaScript and the D3.js SVG-based data visualization library to effectively communicate relationships within a dataset. The graph dynamically renders data points with accurately scaled X and Y axes, including tick labels and coordinate mapping for clear interpretation. Enhanced user engagement by implementing an interactive tooltip feature, allowing users to hover over individual data points to display detailed contextual information. This project demonstrates strong understanding of event-driven UI behavior, data binding, and building accessible, data-driven visual components. Developed using HTML5, CSS3, vanilla JavaScript, and D3.js, and completed as part of FreeCodeCamp’s Data Visualization Certification, representing over 300 hours of applied coursework and serving as one of the final capstone projects.</p>

		</header>
		<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/bGWeXmr" class="image fit"><img src="technicaldoc.png" alt="" /></a>
		<p>
			Developed a single-page technical documentation website focused on presenting structured JavaScript reference content in a clear and accessible format. Built using semantic HTML5 and CSS, incorporating elements such as code blocks, anchored navigation links, and structured lists to support readability and developer-friendly documentation standards. Implemented an in-page navigation system using ID-based anchor linking, enabling users to jump directly to specific documentation sections from the fixed sidebar menu. The persistent navigation improves usability by allowing quick section switching without excessive scrolling. This project was completed as part of FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certification, representing over 300 hours of coursework, and serving as one of the program’s final capstone-style builds.

		<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/XWRKGKp" class="image fit"><img src="tribute.png" alt="" /></a>
		<p>
			Created a responsive single-page tribute website dedicated to a chosen public figure, designed to demonstrate foundational front-end development and semantic layout structure. Built using HTML5 and CSS, with organized content sections leveraging div containers, ID selectors, and embedded imagery to support clean presentation and styling. Implemented interactive navigation through the use of anchor-linked media, embedding an external YouTube reference directly within a clickable image element. This provides users with an intuitive way to access additional content while maintaining a simple, focused page layout. This project was completed as part of FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design Certification, representing over 300 hours of applied coursework, and serving as one of the final capstone projects within the program.
