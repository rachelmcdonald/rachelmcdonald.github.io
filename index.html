					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/rachelmcdonald/cosy-companion" class="image fit"><img src="appthumbnail.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						Cosy Companion is a React-based productivity app that blends task management with gamified progression and an evolving avatar companion. It provides a playful interface for organising daily goals while laying the foundation for a reward-driven user experience. The project is ongoing, with planned features such as unlockable accessories, dynamic backgrounds, lo-fi music integration, and additional quest-style task systems. The app is being built as a long-term portfolio project to showcase full-stack development, UI design, and interactive feature planning.

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/Dio-P/cc_taskmanager_finalProjet" class="image fit"><img src="javaproject.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						Collaborated in a team to design and develop a full-stack task management application that enables users to securely create, organize, and track tasks, goals, and custom categories. Built using Java, Spring Boot, React, and JavaScript, the platform supports full CRUD functionality along with collaboration features, allowing users to add contributors to shared task workflows. Implemented secure user authentication and authorization through Auth0, ensuring each user can only access and manage their own data while logged in. The project demonstrates experience building scalable, secure applications with modern full-stack architecture, RESTful services, and team-based Agile delivery. Development was supported through professional workflows including GitHub version control and branching, with planning and design carried out using Trello, Figma, Miro, and API testing via Insomnia.

					</header>
					<a href="https://github.com/The-Adam-The/whereabouts/tree/develop" class="image fit"><img src="javascriptproject.png" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						Collaborated in a small Agile team to develop an interactive geography-based trivia game, combining general knowledge questions with real-time map-based user input. Built using JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, the application challenges users to answer location-based questions by placing markers directly on a Google Maps API interface. Implemented core game logic including randomized question generation, distance-based scoring calculations, round summaries, and a persistent leaderboard system. This project demonstrates experience delivering a full-stack application with third-party API integration, responsive UI development, and collaborative software engineering workflows.

					<p>
						Developed a full-stack travel bucket list web application as my first solo capstone project during CodeClan’s intensive 800+ hour Software Development programme. Built using Python, Flask, SQL, and PostgreSQL (psycopg2), the app supports complete CRUD functionality for managing countries and cities, with destinations tracked by visited status. Implemented relational data handling, dynamic template rendering with Jinja logic, and a clean, responsive UI with interactive navigation and form-driven workflows. This project demonstrates strong foundations in RESTful design, database-backed applications, and user-focused full-stack development.

					</header>
					<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/VwWNKYO" class="image fit"><img src="pixelrain.png" alt="" /></a>
					 <p>
						 Developed an interactive pixel-based animation in JavaScript to simulate a rainfall-like visual effect over an uploaded image. The project dynamically generates and manipulates approximately 5,000 individual pixel elements, creating the illusion of motion through randomized velocity, size variation, and speed adjustments. Animation logic was implemented using nested for-loops and JavaScript’s Math.random(), demonstrating control over large-scale DOM manipulation and real-time updates. Optimized rendering for smooth performance, and structured the DOM updates to minimize reflows, ensuring consistent animation across different screen sizes.
