									</header>

									<p>Interactive and user-friendly personal portfolio website with clickable call-to-action buttons with added animation. Profile picture created with 'blob' in Figma. This portfolio website was built with the programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript with added stylizing to bring buttons and icons to life when interacted with. The website features a ‘dark mode’ button which, when prompted by the user, will change the colour scheme of the website between ‘light’ and ‘dark’. This website has been built to adapt to the sizes of various handheld devices such as mobile phone, iPad, tablet and laptop.</p>

										Technical Documentation Page</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="https://codepen.io/rachelwils/full/bGWeXmr" class="image fit"><img src="technicaldoc.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>One-page website of displaying technical documentation on information regarding JavaScript, showing the use of ‘code’, 'a' and 'ul'/'li' tags. As part of the challenge, I have successfully used 'id' tags which correspond to the 'a'/‘anchor’ in the navbar within the HTML code which allows the user to be taken to a specific section of the website. As the navigation menu has a "fixed" position, this makes it easier for the user to then select a new area without the need to continuously scroll. This tribute page was built with the programming languages HTML 5 and CSS as part of the final five projects for the Responsive Web Design Certification with FreeCodeCamp for completing 300 hours of coursework.</p>

									<p>Static one-page website of an individual of choice, showing the use of ‘div’, ‘id’ and ‘img’ tags.
